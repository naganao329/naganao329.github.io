Hi there! This site is the website of "Keio Sport & Performance Psychology Lab."
======


What's Keio Sport & Performance Psychology Lab?
======
The lab will be established as a seminar program within [the Institute of Physical Education](https://ipe.hc.keio.ac.jp/) at [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/). It focuses on developing performers’ skills across a wide range of performance domains. In performance settings—including sports, healthcare, the arts, rescue operations, and defense—performers are required to enhance their skills and collaborate effectively as a team.
