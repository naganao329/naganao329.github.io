Welcome to Keio Sport & Performance Psychology Lab!
======
Hi there! This site is the website of "Keio Sport & Performance Psychology Lab."

I’m Naoya Nagata, an educator and researcher specializing in sport and performance psychology. My  research focuses on enhancing practitioners’ performance based on knowledge from psychology and sports science, and on helping practitioners build effective and positive performance environments. In 2026, I will launch my new research laboratory, Keio Sport & Performance Psychology Lab.

What's Keio SPP Lab?
======
The lab will be established as a seminar program within the [Institute of Physical Education](https://ipe.hc.keio.ac.jp/) at [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/). It focuses on developing performers’ skills across a wide range of performance domains. In performance settings—including sports, healthcare, the arts, rescue operations, and defense—performers are required to enhance their abillities and collaborate effectively as a team.

The aims of this lab is to study theories and applications from psychology and sport sciences, and to explore how these insight can be utilized to support performers seeking excellece.
