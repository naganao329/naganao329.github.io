{% include base_path %}

I’m Naoya Nagata, an educator and researcher specializing in sport and performance psychology. My research focuses on performance enhancement, caring & task-involving climate, and attention control.

**Performance enhancement** involves improving performance, particularly among athletes and coaches, by utilizing mental performance skills.

**Caring & task-involving climate** refers to creating a supportive environment that promotes participation and the improvement of sport skills.

**Attentional control** involves engaging in optimal attentional processes, particularly attentional focus and divided attention.

In addition to my university teaching and research, I provide consultation services in the field of sports, supporting both athletes and coaches. I have worked with a wide range of clients—from high school to national-level athletes, and across both individual and team sports. To enhance performance and improve participants’ overall experience, I apply scientific knowledge and evidence-based methods tailored to each client’s needs.<br><br><br>
